Setup:
- set kernelLinkArgs in Query.java according to your system
  (see http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/JLink/tutorial/WritingJavaProgramsThatUseMathematica.html)
- copy your JLink.jar to WebContent/WEB-INF/lib
- at least on a Mac: make sure libJLinkNativeLibrary.jnilib is available (e.g. by copying it to /Library/Java/Extensions).
  Use the system's Java Runtime Environment (1.5 on Mac OS X 10.5) in this case.
- install Tomcat (>= 6), JavaServer Faces (>= 2)
- run the server (in Eclipse: use the Servers tab)
- access the site at e.g. http://localhost:8080/jsf-mathematica/faces/index.xhtml
